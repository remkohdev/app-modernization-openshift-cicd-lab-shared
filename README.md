# IBM Client Developer Advocacy App Modernization Series

## Lab - Automated updates of containerized applications from SCM commits

### Creating a CI/CD Pipeline for deployment to OpenShift  using Jenkins

## Overview

In this lab you will  be connecting your Git repository with the Plants by WebSphere app to a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline built with Jenkins that will deploy to an OpenShift cluster.

## Setup

If you haven't already:

Complete the lab exercise *S2I and Template Lab for the App Modernization Dojo on OpenShift in a shared environment* by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/IBMAppModernization/app-modernization-openshift-templates-lab-shared)

### Step 1: Clone the Github repo that contains the code for the Plants by WebSphere app

1.1  Login in [your Github account](https://github.com)

1.2  In the search bar at the top left type in `app-modernization-plants-by-websphere-jee6`

   ![Search results](images/ss0.png)

1.3  Select the repository `IBMAppModernization\app-modernization-plants-by-websphere-jee6` and then click on the **Fork** icon

1.4  Click the **Clone or download** button from your copy of the forked repo and copy the HTTPS URL to your clipboard

   ![Clone URL](images/ss00.png)

1.5  From the client terminal window clone the Git repo  with  the following commands  appending the HTTPS URL from your clipboard

    ```text
    git clone [HTTPS URL for NEW REPO]
    cd app-modernization-plants-by-websphere-jee6
    ```

### Step 2: Install Jenkins in your OpenShift cluster

2.1 Open the OpenShift web console in your browser

2.2 Make sure you're in the project from the previous lab e.g. *pbw-user012*  (top left) and click on **Add to Project -> Browse Catalog** (top right)

   ![Select project](images/ss8.png)

2.3 Select the **CI/CD** category and click on **Jenkins (Ephemeral)**

   ![Jenkins](images/ss1.png)

2.4 Click **Next**, then click **Next** again. Click **Create anyway** when prompted with a warning

2.5 Click **Continue to the project overview**

2.6 Wait for the pods for Jenkins shows as running (note this may take a few minutes)

### Step 3: Create Pipeline from a template

3.1  From the terminal run the following command to install the Plants by WebSphere pipeline template (note: you need to be in the top level folder of the cloned  Plants by WebSphere GitHub repo i.e. **app-modernization-plants-by-websphere-jee6**

   ```bash
   oc create -f openshift/templates/pbw-liberty-cicd-pipeline.yaml
   ```
3.2 In your Web console browser tab make sure you're in the **pbw-liberty-mariadb** project (top left) and click on **Add to Project -> Browse Catalog** (top right)

3.3 Select the **Other** category and then click **Plants by WebSphere on Liberty CI/CD Pipeline**

3.4 Click **Next**. Change the **Source URL** to the url of your clone of the Plants by WebSphere repo

   ![Source URL](images/ss3.png)

3.5 Click **Create** and then click **Continue to the project overview**

### Step 4: Manually trigger a build to test pipeline

4.1 In your Web console browser tab select **Build -> Pipelines**

  ![Pipelines](images/ss4.png)

4.2 Click on **Start Pipeline**

  ![Start Pipeline](images/ss5.png)

4.3 Once the Pipeline starts click on **View Log**. This will take you into Jenkins and display the Jenkins log for the pipeline. (Note: you may be prompted to use your OpenShift credentials for Jenkins)

   ![View Log](images/ss6.png)

4.4 Verify that the pipeline runs without errors. You should see output like the following:

   ![Pipeline log](images/ss7.png)

### Step 5: Trigger a build via a commit to Github

The BuildConfig for your pipeline is  already configured to be triggered by a Github webhook

5.1 In your Web console browser tab select the **pbw-cicd-pipeline**

  ![Select pipeline](images/ss9.png)

5.2 Click on the **Configuration** tab and then click on the icon next to the **GitHub Webhook URL** to copy it to the clipboard

  ![Copy webhook](images/ss10.png)

5.3 In another browser tab go to https://github.com and select your cloned Plants by WebSphere repository

5.4  Click on the repository settings

   ![Settings](images/ss11.png)

5.5 Under **Options** select **Webhooks** and click **Add webhook**

   ![Add webhook](images/ss12.png)

5.6  For the Payload URL paste in the URL you copied to your clipboard in step 5.2

Change content type to **application/json**

5.7 Change **SSL Verification** to **Disable**

5.8  Accept the other defaults and click **Add webhook**

   ![Add webhook](images/ss13.png)

5.9 In the Github file browser drill down to *pbw-web/src/main/webapp/promo.xhtml*

5.10  Click on the pencil icon to edit **promo.xhtml**  and on line 95 locate the price of the Bonsai Tree

5.11  Change  `$30.00 each` to `<strike>$30.00</strike> $25.00 each`

   This will show the price of the Bonsai Tree as being reduced even more

   ![Reduce Bonsai price](images/ss14.png)

5.12 At the bottom of the UI window add a commit message and click on **Commit changes**

5.13 Switch back to your OpenShift console and open the **pbw-cicd-pipeline**

5.14 Verify that your pipeline  starts building.

5.15 Once the pipeline has completed select **Applications -> Routes** from  the left navigation menu

   ![Routes](images/ss16.png)

5.16 Click on the hostname link for **pbw-liberty-mariadb** to launch the Plants by WebSphere app

5.17 Verify that the price of the bonzai tree has changed.
